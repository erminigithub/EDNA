Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

My project is an online networking platform where users can interact with each other's problems by swiping right to like or left to dislike. Users have the option to choose artificial intelligence or coding problems within their area of expertise to solve. Uploaded problems are sorted and displayed based on users' profile experience and preferences. Difficult problems are assigned to users who earn points for their successful solutions. The platform also leverages data analysis to identify recurring problems and generate effective solutions. 


## Background

This network provides a solution when you encounter a specific and challenging problem and need assistance. It offers the option to upload your own solution, benefiting future users. The platform focuses on addressing emerging issues in artificial intelligence and fosters a supportive community that aids each other at various levels. 


## How is it used?

When you log into the app, it utilizes your profile and preferences to present you with relevant problems. As you solve problems, you earn points that can be later used to seek assistance for your own problems. The app prioritizes your problem based on your points and your track record of problem-solving.

The solution is particularly useful in situations where individuals encounter challenging problems that require specialized knowledge or skills. It caters to users who are seeking solutions or guidance in areas such as artificial intelligence or coding. The platform should consider the needs of users who require assistance with complex problems and those who are knowledgeable and willing to provide solutions.

Factors such as the user's level of expertise, the urgency of the problem, and the availability of other users with relevant skills should be taken into account. The solution can be beneficial in various environments, including professional settings, educational institutions, and online communities dedicated to problem-solving. Time-sensitive problems can be addressed efficiently by leveraging the collective expertise of the user base.

Also, solve the problem of getting bored. For example, your company use this network. One day you go to work and you choose what you wnat to do, solve a easy problem, teach how is solve or go for a better problem. 

## Data sources and AI methods

the data come from the users, before you train a bit for differents problems, so the software can show you the right problem to you. 


## Challenges

the problem do noy solve the users wants to quit the app and the ethical of what they are helping with. Also, is for people who is starting and maybe not a lot of people like it 


## What next?

sell the app to a company, so you wnat that your staff use the systems. and to record and show all the solutions of the problems made. Make a abstract about the common problems and solutions.

is just an idea...
